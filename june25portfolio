Coding Topics

Hibernate
This week I did research on Hibernate and I feel like I got a better understanding of mapping, the importance of the xml files, and HQL. I did most of my research on tutorialspoint because they have a way of explaining it that I can understand. 
I do a sharing video on it here: It starts at 0:00

My code from the video is here:
This is the parent folder for the code:

Client and Server Sockets
This week I did some research on client and server sockets. The client-server relationship is a huge part of IT, and you can do some great stuff with it in Java. I recorded a video and added to my URL tool program. I made it so my program can connect my computer (the client) to a website (the server) using port 80. 
This was added to my URL tool, so it uses almost all the coding topics. 
My code for that is here:

Application Controller Pattern. 
This week I did some research on the application controller pattern. It seems to me like this development pattern is similar to the front controller pattern, and I was able to find information about that. The good news is that I used the instructor’s post that had a link to a text book that taught the ACP.

Java Collections
This isn’t from this week, but my feedback from my last portfolio made me feel like I messed up when I explained what I did for this. I use one each of Map, List, Set, and Tree to add and remove strings from a list. Java collections is very useful for data storage, so I was able to store and remove strings in this class. 
Note to the instructor: I already had this in my last portfolio, and nothing has been changed. I just wanted to make sure you saw this because the feedback that I received made me feel like I didn’t do a good job showing you this. If you did see it, it is still the same. 
The code for it is here:
