HTTP URL Connection
I was able to make a small simple program that allows the user to enter a website in the console and it will display the 
source code of the website. However, it only displays the front end source code, I couldn't figure out how to make it display 
PHP, and I'm not even sure if that's possible.

Junit Test
With JUnit tests I was able to make an application that had two tests. It was very simple, but it helped me understand to make 
it work and test variables.
