JSON Serialization
This week I was trying to understand JSON serialization but I had a hard time getting anything to compile. At first I didn’t understand the concept of downloading and using jars, but after watching a few videos and reading an article about it I was able to use a JSON jar file and get a few errors to go away. After I got that working I couldn’t get the code to compile because Eclipse was giving me errors that I didn’t understand. I decided to delete my code but keep my setup with the jar file and try something really simple. I got it to compile and it helped me understand the importance of JSON serialization.

Use Case Document
From what I understand a use case document is the typed out version of a use case diagram. For me, use cases are very helpful, so I typed researched how to type up a use case document and I made one for the flashcard app. I taught about it at 0:00 here
