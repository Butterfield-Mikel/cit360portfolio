Overall description of what I worked on this week. - submited 5/6/2016

Organizing the team and setting up group tools – professionalism

The first thing I worked on this week was setting up group tools and organizing a team. It’s not easy to figure out a time for 8 guys to meet up all at the same time. Naturally, when I saw that this is what I had to do twice, I became anxious and I tried to organize the meetings the best I could. I posted on the team contact information discussion board and organized a time for us all to meet. I was very proactive in contacting everyone and I even volunteered to set up the google hangout on air and record the meeting. We now have a weekly time that works for all of us.

After our first team meeting we had our community, GitHub, and other team tools set up. I was able to post to the community as outlined in ILearn.  We also made a time for our second meeting. During our second meeting we presented on the topics that we volunteered for. I attended both group meetings and I was able to learn a lot from the other student’s teaching topics.

Teaching topic 

I volunteered to teach topic #10 use case diagrams. I made a use case diagram for my elevator pitch app and a PowerPoint presentation to go along with my lesson. 

Direct evidence

I made a post in the team contact information discussion board in the lesson 2 folder on 5/2/2016 at 3:47 PM. It is proof that I helped organize a team meeting, and it says:
“It looks like we have to meet 2 times this week. It looks like everyone who has posted here so far can meet tomorrow at 1:30pm MST. I will post the link to a google hangout to this discussion board tomorrow at 1:30 pm MST. I will also email the URL.
  All you have to do is follow the URL and if you are logged into google and you have hangouts downloaded you can get in and we can meet. 
  Because we have to meet 2 times this week I am just going to go ahead plan for 1:30 tomorrow unless you all decide another time. I hope this works out, this is a lot of people's schedules to accommodate.
Also, I think starting a group text would be helpful to keep everyone informed. Let me know if you agree and we can change phone numbers...”

I set up and recorded the videos. You can see that it is on my YouTube channel.
